# cs203-S2019-assessment

This repository contains the assessment sheet for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/). The instructor
will add this assessment sheet to a new GitHub Classroom repository when
the software engineering team is completing an assignment.

## The Assessment Sheet

This assessment sheet was created through the combined work of many students.
The goal of this assessment sheet is to provide both the instructor and the
class with a way to track the progress of skills related to
software engineering. The Assessment Sheet is divided into technical and
professional sections. The technical section contains these subsections:

* Software Development with Python
* Project Management with GitHub
* Continuous Integration with Travis
* Foundations of Software Engineering

The prfessional skills section contains these subsections:

* Individual
* Ground
* Interactions

The specifics of each subsection can be found in the `assessment.md` document
[here](assessment.md).
