  variables, functions, and methods
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
  * N = Student does use exception handling for the possibility of unexpected
  user input
  * I = Student introduces try and except statements but does not have any clause
  * A = Student utilizes try and except statements or user defined exceptions, 
  however, clause does not function

  * E = Student correctly codes exception handling with clause being perfectly executed
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
  * N = No refactoring done or changed functions completely
