# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
  * N = Fails to perform any setup and configuration of Travis CI
  * I = Setting up and configuring Travis CI which performs no checks
  * A = Sets up and configures Travis CI without performing checks on all relevant project deliverables
  * G = Sets up and configures Travis CI to perform most relevant checks on project deliverables
  * E = Correctly sets up and configures Travis CI to perform all relevant checks for project deliverables
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
  * N = Does not utilize Travis CI when releasing project deliverables
  * I = Performs a release through Travis CI which is not secured
  * A = Performs a release through Travis CI which is mostly secured
  * G = Performs a secure release through Travis CI while failing to sign commits
  * E = Utilizes a fully-encrypted Travis CI to perform a secure release
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
  * N = No attempt to incorporate a third party integration
  * I = Third party integrations were implemented but unsuccessful
  * A = A minority of third party integrations were implemented with many errors
  * G = A majority of the third party integrations  are successfully implemented with little to no error
  * E = All necessary third party integrations are successfully created without error
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
