# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
 * N = Student did not use docstrings
 * I = Students incorrectly attempted docstrings unidentifiable to compiler
 * A = Student added docstrings, but it does not fully prescribe the functions/methods effect as a command
 * G = Student successfully added docstring with useful description, but is lacking some proper syntax
 * E = Student successfully added docstring with useful description and proper syntax

* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
 * N = Student used inappropriate naming styles that are neither prescriptive or descriptive
 * I = Student used inappropriate naming styles that are either not prescriptive or descriptive
 * A = Students used appropriate naming styles that are not entirely conventional
 * G = Student used appropriate naming styles, but may be missing syntax used with a variable, function, method or etc.
 * E = Student used appropriate naming styles with the correct syntax used with a variable, function, method or etc.

* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
 * N = Student does use exception handling for the possibility of unexpected user input
 * I = Student introduces try and except statements but does not have any clause
 * A = Student correctly utilizes try and except statements or user defined exceptions, but clause does not function
 * G = Student correctly codes exception handling, but clause doesn't fully execute
 * E = Student correctly codes exception handling with clause being perfectly executed

* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
