## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python

* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
 language)

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
* Software architecture
* Software design
* Software documentation
* Programming styles
* Managing software complexity
* Mitigating software risk

## Professional Skills

### Individual

* Continuous learning about
 * Python software development
    * N = S lack of new knowledge and/or contributions to any project
    * I = Incomplete knowledge or minuscule contributions to projects
    * A = An average amount of knowledge and contributions to each project
    * G = An above average amount of knowledge and contributions to each project
    * E = Going above and beyond the expectations and contributions of others
 * Project management with GitHub, specifically the Flow Model
    * N = A complete disregard for the model, especially multiple instances of overriding the master branch
    * I = Occasional disregard for the model including overriding the master branch
    * A = Almost always adhering to model, but never overriding the master branch
    * G = Making only minor mistakes while trying to follow the model and providing a positive influence on other aspects such as issues and communication
    * E = A lack of mistakes in addition to emerging as a leader who provides support to others who may be struggling with project management
 * Continuous integration with Travis
    * N = Failing to enable Travis at all or not passing any requirements on any assignment
    * I = Enabling Travis, but failing the majority of checks
    * A = Enabling Travis, and passing a majority of Travis checks
    * G = Enabling Travis, and passing all of the Travis checks
    * E = Enabling Travis, passing all checks, and assisting others who are struggling or improving issues with Travis if found
 * Foundations of software engineering practices
<<<<<<< HEAD
    * N = Working separate from a team with no communication
    * I = Working with a team a small amount of the time with no communication
    * A = Working well with a team half of the time with very little communication
    * G = Working well with a team most of the time with clear communication
    * E = Working well with a team all of the time with clear and constructive communication

* Understanding and avoiding red flags
    * N = Ignoring all red flags
    * I = Would be identifying red flags, but not fixing them
    * A = Identifying and fixing a red flag
    * G = Identifying, understanding and fixing a red flag to prevent future bugs
    * E = Identifying, understanding, and fixing all red flags
* Understanding and adopting best practices
    * N = A severe lack of understanding and refusal to adopt best practices
    * I = Slight understanding and occasional use and identification of the best practices
    * A = An average amount of understanding and general identification and use of best practices
    * G = Above average demonstrations of understanding and the ability to find and utilize best practices
    * E = Full understanding of concepts, would also include the ability to determine which practices are better than others and then applying those practices

### Group

* Attendance
* Deadlines
* Communication
* Participation
* Conduct
* Decisions
* Postmortems
* Conflicts
* Infractions

### Interactions

* Interaction with the customer
* Interaction with the team leaders
* Interaction with the course instructor
* Interaction with the teaching assistants

## Revision of Guides
* Revising the assessment form
    * N = Not reading the assessment form nor making contributions to it
    * I = Not reading the assessment form in its final state, but making minor contributions thus improving the initial state
    * A = A complete understanding of the assessment form and some contributions in order to enhance it
    * G = A complete understanding of the assessment form and multiple contributions to improve it
    * E = A complete understanding of the assessment form, major contributions, and continuing to improve it throughout the semester as needed
* Revising the code of conduct
    * N = Not reading the code of conduct nor making contributions to it
    * I = Not reading the code of conduct in its final state, but making minor contributions thus improving the initial state
    * A = A complete understanding of the code of conduct and some contributions in order to enhance it
    * G = A complete understanding of the code of conduct and multiple contributions to improve it
    * E = A complete understanding of the code of conduct, major contributions, and continuing to improve it throughout the semester as needed
