# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
  * N = No refactoring done or changed functions completely
  * I = Lack of documentation and clearly identifiable functions/code
  * A = Some changes can be made but well documented
  * G = Includes easy to understand functions and documentation
  * E = Clean and efficient code that is well documented
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
  * N = No debugging done
  * I = Identified bugs in system but no fix
  * A = Fixed some identified bugs using logging/other methods
  * G = Fixed most identified bugs using logging/other methods
  * E = Fixed all or most bugs using multiple methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs
  * N = No written code or monolithic code
  * I = Language constructs used inappropriate way
  * A = Some language constructs used appropriately
  * G = Some or many language constructs used efficiently
  * E = Several language constructs used efficiently and reason is documented

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
