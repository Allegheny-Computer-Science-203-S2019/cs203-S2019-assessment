# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)

### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering
  * N = No effort to document, define, or maintain requirements present
  * I = Very brief or unspecific documentation, definition, and maintenance given
  * A = Explains what was done with enough detail to convey the most important information
  * G = Documentation and definition are well written and gives other team members an informed idea of the process
  * E = The software engineer displayed highly detailed, elaborate, and complete documentation, definition, and maintenance in the given design process
* Software architecture
  * N = There is no concrete structure and the master branch is broken
  * I = There are small amounts of structure to the code where it may or may not run correctly, and the master branch is broken
  * A = There is a blueprint for the software system that lacks completion, and the master branch is not broken
  * G = There is a completed blueprint for the software system and a working master branch
  * E = The software system contains high-level structures that contain software elements in a complex and complete blueprint of the software system, and the master branch has no errors and contains completed code
* Software design
  * N = No problem solving steps taken
  * I = Initial steps are taken to conceptualize, frame, and implement systems
  * A = Some software design is visible to the point where a software solution looks to be developed soon
  * G = A software solution is created that includes both an algorithm design and a high-level architecture design
  * E = All goals and expectations of the design are met and compatibility, reliability, reusability, and scalability are included    while a software solution is ultimately created that includes both an algorithm design and a high-level architecture design
* Software documentation
  * N = No explanation or comments about how to use or how the software works
  * I = A few comments in the code that are not detailed
  * A = Documentation has a bit of detail for every main part of the program
  * G = Documentation is detailed and visible for most of the software within the source code
  * E = Explains in great detail how to use and operate the computer software within the source code
* Programming styles
  * N = Programming style is not set and always changing around during the program
  * I = Not a clear programming style but has some implementation of general styles
  * A = Some clarity of a programming style with multiple styles implemented
  * G = Programming style is implemented well with a few variances throughout
  * E = One distinct style of programming that is clear and easy to understand
* Managing software complexity
  * N = The code does not run properly, files are not in the right place, or some other part of the project has been completely broken
  * I = Little effort is put forth to keep code clean or organized, some code may not work properly
  * A = Basic organization is achieved, no major parts of the projects are affected by any lax in management
  * G = The project is logically and effectively organized with no issues in the code resulting from poor organization
  * E = Everything is exceedingly well organized, with no excess or lack of files, folders, branches, forks, etc.
* Mitigating software risk
  * N = No procedure is followed, the master branch is broken, or files are corrupted
  * I = The engineer avoids causing damage to the work of others, but may not produce any safely compatible source code
  * A = Major issues are avoided and a few small complications may occur, none that
  ruin the flow of work for the team
  * G = Almost no problems occur while working with code or branches, does not slow down productivity for self or others
  * E = All interactions with new and existing code are free from complications or other issues, everything works smoothly and completely free of errors
