# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
  * N = None
  None would indicate that someone did not use the issue tracker.
  * I = Inadequate
  Inadequate would indicate that an issue is posted but it is either redundant or incomprehensible.
  Ex. "Ajssjdjssd"(incomprehensible) or posting that a program's main method is broken when three other people have done the same thing.
  * A = Adequate
  Adequate would indicate that the issue posted is neither redundant nor incomprehensible, but isn't  
  descriptive or clear.
  Ex. "Your program is broken."
  * G = Good
  Good would indicate that the issue posted is neither redundant nor incomprehensible, and is moderately
  descriptive and clear. Ex. "Your math function is broken."
  * E = Excellent
  Good would indicate that the issue posted is neither redundant nor incomprehensible, and is detailed and
  easy to understand and follow. Ex. "Your math function is broken because you forgot a semi-colon." Error
  messages from the terminal can also be incorporated. Ex "Terminal said that the function was given too
  many arguments."

* Using the GitHub flow model*
  * N = None
  N Would indicate that someone pushed directly to the master branch instead of pushing to one of the
  subbranches. Additionally, they had nonsensical commit messages, and did not create or use repository
  branches or forks correctly, and also performed incorrect merges and pull requests.  
  * I = Inadequate
   Inadequate would indicate that forks, and repositories are made correctly. Additionally, merges and pull requests are done correctly and the commit messages can be understood, but the programmer pushed to the master branch.  Good would indicate that the issue posted is neither redundant nor incomprehensible, and is moderately
  descriptive and clear.
  * A = Adequate
   Adequate would indicate that the programmer correctly made subbranches and did not push to the master branch. Merge and pull requests are done correctly, commit messages can be understood. Additionally, all forks and repositories were made correctly as well.
  * E = Excellent
    An excellent branch would be a purposeful branch that has a descriptive label. Had strong commit
    messages, in addition to using and creating repository branches, forks, and pull request correctly.
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages*
  * N = None
  None would indicate that the commit message was nonsensical. An example of this would be random strings of letters 'sdhjhsdjsd'.
  * I = Inadequate
  Inadequate would indicate that the commit message wasn't nonsensical, but ultimately uninformative. An example of this would be "I am so angry" or "Please work".
  * A = Adequate
  Adequate would indicate that the commit message both made sense and was descriptive, to an extent. An example of this would be "X.py is broken." or "I added lines to the main method"
  * G = Good
  Good would indicate that the commit message was both clear, and moderately descriptive. "The main method
  of X.py is broken." or "created three new variables in the main method"
  * E = Excellent
  Excellent indicates a adequately detailed and clear commit message. "The main method isn't calling correctly" or "created three ints in the main method"

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
