# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
  * N = None
  * I = Inadequate
  * A = Adequate
  * G = Good
  * E = Excellent
* Using the GitHub flow model*
  * N = None
  N Would indicate that someone pushed directly to the master branch instead of pushing to one of the subbranches.
  * I = Inadequate
  Inadequate would indicate that the branch is either Superflous or poorly named. Additionally, this would also indicate that the commit messages are poorly made.
  * A = Adequate
  * G = Good
  * E = Excellent
    An excellent branch would be a purposeful branch that has a descriptive label.
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages*
  * N = None
  None would indicate that the commit message was nonsensical. An example of this would be random strings of letters 'sdhjhsdjsd'.
  * I = Inadequate
  Inadequate would indicate that the commit message wasn't nonsensical, but ultimately uninformative. An example of this would be "I am so angry" or "Please work".
  * A = Adequate
  Adequate would indicate that the commit message both made sense and was descriptive, to an extent. An example of this would be "X.py is broken."
  * G = Good
  Good would indicate that the commit message was both clear, and moderately descriptive.
  * E = Excellent

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)

* Software architecture
* Software design
* Software documentation
* Programming styles
* Managing software complexity
* Mitigating software risk
