# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
  * N = Did not utilize `pytest`
  * I = Found many errors that were not resolved
  * A = Found errors that were not resolved
  * G = Found few errors that were not resolved
  * E = Found minimal errors and resolved most errors
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
  * N = Did not utilize `pytest`
  * I = Found many errors that were not resolved
  * A = Found errors that were not resolved
  * G = Found few errors that were not resolved
  * E = Found minimal errors and resolved most errors
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
  * N = Did not utilize `pytest` for code coverage
  * I = Test suite has low percent of coverage (30 and Below)
  * A = Test suite has moderate percent of coverage (30 - 50)
  * G = Test suite has an acceptable percent of coverage (50 - 80)
  * E = Test suite has a high percent of coverage (80 - 100)
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
  * N = Did not utilize online provider for code coverage
  * I = Test suite has low percent of coverage (30 and Below)
  * A = Test suite has moderate percent of coverage (30 - 50)
  * G = Test suite has an acceptable percent of coverage (50 - 80)
  * E = Test suite has a high percent of coverage (80 - 100)
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
