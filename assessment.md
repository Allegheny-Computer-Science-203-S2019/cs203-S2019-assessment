# Assessment for Team-Based Project Work

## Assessment Key

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
  * N = Routinely committing edits to the master branch or not pushing to correct branches receives a none grade
  * I = Creating branches with unclear names and no descriptions will receive an inadequate grade
  * A = Branches named sensibly with unique code and descriptions that adequately describe the branch's purpose receive an adequate grade
  * G = Well documented changes to correct well-named and necessary branches will receive a good grade
  * E = Immaculately documented changes on branches that serve extremely important purposes will receive an excellent grade
* Creating and using a repository fork
  * N = Pushing to the wrong fork or making forks that serve no purpose will receive a non grade
  * I = Forks with unclear names and purposes will receive an inadequate grade
  * A = Creating and pushing to forks that are necessary to our design that have detailed annotations will receive an adequate grade
  * G = Highly detailed forks with well-kept history and well-annotated code will receive a good grade
  * E = Immaculately detailed forks with an impeccably annotated history will receive an excellent grade
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
  * N = Not communicating changes before merging branches and forks receives a none grade
  * I = Merging with lackluster communication with the team or merging faulty code receives an inadequate grade
  * A = Communicating changes with the team and reconciling differences between code receives and adequate grade
  * G = Merging branches after extensive communication with the team receives a good grade
  * E = Immaculately detailed code and communication with the team before merging receives an excellent grade
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
