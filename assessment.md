## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python
  * N = Unable to setup development environment
  * I = Minimal development environment for Python.
  * A = Basic development environment configured, including proper dependencies
  and development tools.
  * G = Additional development tools configured, in addition to minimum required
  dependencies and developments
  * E = Additional development tools configured and able to provide assistance
  and troubleshooting to other students regarding their own development
  environment
* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
  * N = `pyenv` and `pipenv` not installed or setup
  * I = Unable to run programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
  * A = Able to run programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`
  * G = Able to run programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv` using additional commands
  and flags as necessary
  * E = Able to run programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv` using additional commands
  and flags to streamline workflow, while being able to provide assistance and
  troubleshooting to other students using `pyenv` and `pipenv`
* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`
  * N = `pylint` and `flake8` not installed or setup
  * I = Unable to run `pylint` and `flake8` to lint Python programs
  * A = Able to run `pylint` and `flake8` to lint Python programs and
  successfully address output to ensure program passes `pylint` and `flake8`
  * G = Same requirements as level 'A' in addition to understanding other
  functionalities of `pylint` and `flake8` such as suppressing messages and
  overrides
  * E = Same requirements as level 'G' in addition to being able to help other
  students trouble shoot `pylint` and `flake8`
* Formatting Python programs with `black`
  * N = `black` not installed or setup
  * I = Unable to run `black` to format Python programs
  * A = Able to run `black` to format Python programs
  * G = Same requirements as level 'A' in addition to solving any problems with the installation of `black`
  * E = Same requirements as level 'G' in addition to being able to help other students troubleshoot
* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Advanced testing of Python programs with `pytest`
* Calculating code coverage of a `pytest` test suite
* Reporting code coverage through an online provider
* Using docstrings to document a Python program
 * N = Student did not use docstrings
 * I = Students incorrectly attempted docstrings unidentifiable to compiler
 * A = Student added docstrings, but it does not fully prescribe the functions/methods effect as a command
 * G = Student successfully added docstring with useful description, but is lacking some proper syntax
 * E = Student successfully added docstring with useful description and proper syntax

* Adopting and applying appropriate naming conventions
 * N = Student used inappropriate naming styles that are neither prescriptive or descriptive
 * I = Student used inappropriate naming styles that are either not prescriptive or descriptive
 * A = Students used appropriate naming styles that are not entirely conventional
 * G = Student used appropriate naming styles, but may be missing syntax used with a variable, function, method or etc.
 * E = Student used appropriate naming styles with the correct syntax used with a variable, function, method or etc.

* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program
 * N = Student does use exception handling for the possibility of unexpected user input
 * I = Student introduces try and except statements but does not have any clause
 * A = Student correctly utilizes try and except statements or user defined exceptions, but clause does not function
 * G = Student correctly codes exception handling, but clause doesn't fully execute
 * E = Student correctly codes exception handling with clause being perfectly executed

* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics
* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods
* Adopting and using appropriate Python language constructs

### Project Management with GitHub

* Using the issue tracker
* Using the GitHub flow model
* Creating and using a repository branch
* Creating and using a repository fork
* Merging a branch or a fork to another branch or fork
* Creating and reviewing a pull request
* Using appropriate commit messages

### Continuous Integration with Travis

* Setup and configure Travis CI
* Perform secure releases of project deliverables
* Create third-party integrations with Travis CI (e.g., codecov.io)
* Add README badges that show status of Travis CI builds
* Add README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
